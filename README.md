# WHiDL

![cargo build](https://github.com/whidl/whidl/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)
![cargo test](https://github.com/whidl/whidl/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

## Quick Start

The goal of this quick start section is to provide as fast as possible
series of steps for seeing WHiDL in action. The hello world example will
be creating a `Not` chip from NAND gates and converting it to VHDL.

The easiest way to run WHiDL is to use a devcontainer. The devcontainer has
been tested with GitHub codespaces. Give instructions here for launching the
codespace.

## Documentation

In-progress documentation is at [whidl.io](https://whidl.io/). 
The docs source is the `docs` directory in this repository. See `docs/README.md`
for more information.
