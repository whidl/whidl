# Assignment

Sometimes you need to copy a variable to another variable. Instead of using the = sign for assignment like in, say Python, it uses `<=`. This is the same syntax that other hardware description languages use, and it indicates that you are *redirecting* a signal from a wire.  Practically, `x <= y` just copies the value in y to x.

``` hdl
// This is a dummy chip that always outputs true. 
CHIP Dummy {
    IN in;
    OUT out;
    PARTS:
    
    out <= true;
}
```


You can also copy individual bits from a bus. You just need to specify what index or range of values you want to copy. The below example simply sets the 5th bit of the input to 1 and outputs the modified input.

``` hdl
CHIP AssignmentExample {
    IN in[5];
    OUT out[5];
    PARTS:
    
    in[4] <= true;
    out <= in;
}

```
``` hdl
CHIP AssignmentExample {
    IN in[10];
    OUT out[10];
    PARTS:
    
    // You can also use a range of indices
    in[5..9] <= true;
    out <= in;
}
```
