# Synthesizing VHDL

## WHiDL usage

The WHiDL subcommand to synthesize VHDL from HDL is `synth-vhdl`.

```
whidl-synth-vhdl 
Creates VHDL and Quartus TCL. This command can be used to convert an HDL file to VHDL, or a
nand2tetris test into a Modelsim testbench. The output is a TCL script for creating a Quartus Prime
project using quartus_sh, or a testbench to run with Modelsim

USAGE:
    whidl synth-vhdl <PATH> <OUTPUT_DIR>

ARGS:
    <PATH>          Path to either a top-level HDL file or a .tst test script to convert from
                    nand2tetris from to VHDL
    <OUTPUT_DIR>    The synth-vhdl command creates a Quartus Prime project in a new folder. This
                    is the folder to create for the project

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help    Print help information
```

For example, from the 

## Compiling VHDL with Quartus Prime

WHiDL synthesizes and entire Quartus Prime project. If you are using
the WHiDL codespace, then the free community edition of Quartus Prime will
be preinstalled. From within the generated quartus prime project directory,
the following commands can be used to compile the project.

```
quartus_sh -t project.tcl
quartus_sh --flow compile $NAMEOFYOURCHIP
```

## Synthesizing Tests

In addition to converting VHDL entities to HDL chips, WHiDL can also
convert nand2tetris into Modelsim tests. This detection happens automatically.
