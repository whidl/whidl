# Synthesizing VHDL

## WHiDL usage

The WHiDL subcommand to synthesize VHDL from HDL is `synth-vhdl`.

Let's see how we can synthesizes the VHDL for a simple And gate. In 
HDL, an AND gate can be implemented as so:

```
CHIP And {
    IN a, b;
    OUT out;

    PARTS:
    Nand(a=a, b=b, out=notOut);
    Not(in=notOut, out=out);
}
```

In the WHiDL repository, there is a copy of the And gate at `resources/tests/nand2tetris/solutions/And.hdl`.


```bash
whidl synth-vhdl --output-dir output resources/tests/nand2tetris/solutions/And.hdl
```

Replace output with your desired output directory. After running this command,
you should have a new VHDL and TCL file for generating then Quartus Prime
project in the specified output directory.

You can see the generated VHDL for the `And` chip and all supporting chips in
the output directory.

WHiDL synthesizes and entire Quartus Prime project. If you are using
the WHiDL codespace, then the free community edition of Quartus Prime will
be preinstalled. From within the generated quartus prime project directory,
the following commands can be used to compile the project.

```
quartus_sh -t project.tcl
quartus_sh --flow compile And
```

## Synthesizing Tests

In addition to converting VHDL entities to HDL chips, WHiDL can also
convert nand2tetris into Modelsim tests. This detection happens automatically.
