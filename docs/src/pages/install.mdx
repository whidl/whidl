# Installing WHiDL

Currently, WHiDL is intended to be used in a pre-built environment. This
is because of the dependency on Quartus Prime.

### GitHub codespaces

### Docker


## Cargo

## Web Assembly

See the `docs` directory for an example React application that relies
on WHiDL wasm to create interactive documentation.
