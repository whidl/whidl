# Generics

Whidl allows you to use generic variables for the length of the bus. In the below example, we create a chip with the generic value X. Wherever we use the chip, we supply a number, and that number will be used in place of X.

``` hdl
CHIP Dummy<X> {
    IN in[X];
    OUT out[X];
    
    out <= in;
}
```
 
This dummy chip just copies the input to the output. The difference between this chip and the chip used as an example for assignment, is that it takes in input or arbitrary length, and the output will match the length. The generic value is supplied when the chip is used.

``` hdl
CHIP Example1 {
    IN in[10];
    OUT out[10];
    
    PARTS:
    
    Dummy<10>(in=in, out=out);
}

```

``` hdl
CHIP Example1 {
    IN in[5];
    OUT out[5];
    
    PARTS:
    
    Dummy<5>(in=in, out=out);
}
```
