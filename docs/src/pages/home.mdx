# Basics

Whidl is an extension of HDL, an educational language used by the popular course
<Link component={RouterLink} target="_blank">Nand2Tetris</Link>. HDL stands
for "hardware description language," which of course more broadly refers
to the class of hardware description languages including Verilog and VHDL. Here
when we say HDL we are referring specifically to the Nand2Tetris HDL.

Unlike C++ or Java, HDL is a declarative language for circuit design with
two primitive components: a D flip-flip and a NAND gate. All other components
are abstractions on top of these two primitives.

``` hdl
CHIP {
    IN: a, b;
    OUT: out;

    PARTS:
    // x is usable here, even though it is defined later
    Or(a=false, b=x, out=out);
    And(a=a, b=b, out=x);
}

```

The following chapters deal with the extensions added to HDL by whidl, and how
to use the bundled tools.
