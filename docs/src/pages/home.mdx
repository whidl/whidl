# Basics

Whidl is essentially an extension of HDL, an educational language used by the popular course Nand2Tetris. HDL stands for "hardware description language", and the term actually refers to a class of languages used for (as you might guess) designing computer hardware. Some of the most popular hardware description languages in use are verilog and vhdl, but there are many others. We will use HDL to refer to the extended Nand2Tetris language as opposed to the class of languages.

HDL operates on the same boolean (true/false) values that the circuitry of your computer uses. These correspond to the binary values 1 (for true) and 0 (for false). These values are stored in variables, just like any other language. 

One major thing to note is that HDL is "declarative", meaning that you are not defining "step-by-step" behaviour from a start point like you are in C++ or Python. You can put something in the variable x at the end of the file, and that value will be accessible to any code at the beginning of the file.

``` hdl
CHIP {
    IN: a, b;
    OUT: out;

    PARTS:
    // x is usable here, even though it is defined later
    Or(a=false, b=x, out=out);
    
    And(a=a, b=b, out=x);
}

```

The following chapters deal with the extensions added to HDL by whidl, and how to use the bundled tools.
